## Customizing and Localizing AnyConnect

Cisco AnyConnect can be customized to meet specific requirements by altering installation configurations, modifying client settings, and enabling localization features.

### Customizing Installation Behavior

* Modify installation options through the `ACTransforms.xml` file for both Windows and macOS.
* Deactivate the Customer Experience Feedback feature if it is not necessary.

```xml
<ACTransforms>
    <DisableVPN>true</DisableVPN>
</ACTransforms>
```

### Localization Features

* Change the AnyConnect interface, alerts, and installer messages to your preferred language.
* Add a custom Help file, if needed.
* Use translation tables to modify or localize interface text and notifications.

## AnyConnect Profile Editor

Administrators use the Profile Editor to set up VPN profiles, configure connection settings, and enforce security policies. Important configuration sections include:

* **Preferences**: Control general settings and the auto-reconnect behavior.
* **Backup Servers**: Specify alternate VPN servers for failover situations.
* **Certificate Matching**: Define the rules for certificate usage.
* **Mobile Policy**: Configure policies related to mobile devices.
* **Server List**: Organize the available VPN servers list.

## Configuring VPN Access

AnyConnect offers several VPN connection features. Key options include:

* **Start Before Logon (SBL)**: Allows the VPN connection to initiate before the user logs into Windows.
* **Always-On VPN**: Keeps VPN connections constantly active.
* **Trusted Network Detection (TND)**: Automatically connects or disconnects based on the network environment.
* **Captive Portal Detection**: Detects restricted networks and triggers authentication portals.

```bash
# Example: Enable Trusted Network Detection
vpn config trusted_network_detection enable
```

## Managing VPN Authentication

AnyConnect supports a variety of authentication methods:

* **Certificate-based authentication**: Verifies users via digital certificates.
* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Adds an extra layer of security during login.
* **SAML Authentication**: Integrates with identity providers for simplified login processes.

### Enabling Certificate Authentication

To set up certificate-based authentication:

1. Generate and import the required certificates.
2. Define matching criteria in the connection profile.
3. Configure VPN profiles to mandate certificate authentication.

## Network Access Manager

The Network Access Manager (NAM) is responsible for managing network-level authentication and enforcing access control policies.

* Supports authentication protocols such as **EAP, PEAP, TTLS, and TLS**.
* Applies security policies to both wired and wireless connections.
* Provides **Single Sign-On (SSO)** for improved user convenience.

> **Tip:** Configure fallback authentication methods within NAM profiles to ensure more reliable connections.

## Configuring Posture Compliance

Posture compliance ensures that client devices meet corporate security standards before access is granted.

* **HostScan**: Checks the endpoint's compliance status.
* **ISE Posture Module**: Works with Cisco ISE for policy enforcement.
* **Advanced Endpoint Assessment**: Evaluates antivirus and firewall configurations.

```json
{
    "compliance": {
        "antivirus": "enabled",
        "firewall": "active"
    }
}
```

## Using Network Visibility Module (NVM)

The Network Visibility Module (NVM) provides detailed insights into network activity for improved threat detection.

* Collects information about application usage, traffic patterns, and device interactions.
* Allows for fine-grained filtering of traffic for analysis.
* Integrates with SIEM platforms for advanced monitoring.

> **Note:** Ensure that all necessary kernel driver modules are properly installed and configured to activate NVM features.

## Troubleshooting AnyConnect

If you run into issues with AnyConnect, try these troubleshooting steps:

* **Check logs** located at `C:\ProgramData\Cisco\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\Logs`.
* **Use DART** (Cisco’s Diagnostic and Reporting Tool) to gather data for troubleshooting.
* **Verify connectivity** to the VPN server.
* **Reinstall the client** if the issue persists after troubleshooting.

## AnyConnect on Mobile Devices

AnyConnect is available for iOS and Android devices, offering features like:

* **Per-App VPN**: Restricts VPN access to specific applications.
* **Always-On VPN**: Ensures the VPN connection stays active continuously.
* **Split Tunneling**: Routes selected traffic through the VPN while directing other traffic directly.

### Setting Up Mobile VPN on iOS

1. Download AnyConnect from the App Store.
2. Configure VPN profiles and login settings.
3. Enable **Per-App VPN** within the device’s VPN settings.

```yaml
vpn:
  enable: true
  mode: per-app
```
